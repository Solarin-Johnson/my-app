      title: "Why Clean UI Matters",
      content: [
        "A cluttered UI confuses users, while a clean design makes interactions effortless. By focusing on simplicity, spacing, and consistency, you create an intuitive experience that improves usability and engagement.",
        "Top companies prioritize clean UI to boost user engagement and retention. A well-structured interface reduces cognitive load and enhances user satisfaction. Understanding the psychology behind clean design helps you craft more user-friendly and scalable interfaces.",

      title: "Typography and Readability",
      content: [
        "Typography sets the tone for your app. Choose readable fonts like Inter or Roboto, maintain proper spacing, and ensure a clear text hierarchy to create a pleasant reading experience.",
        "Headings should stand out without overwhelming the screen. Proper line height, font weight, and spacing improve readability. Keep body text at a comfortable size, typically between 14px and 16px, and avoid excessive bold or italic styles that can strain the eyes.",
        "Consider accessibility in typography choices. Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG standards, avoid using only color to convey meaning, and use dynamic scaling for different screen sizes.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Spacing and Layout",
      content: [
        "White space (negative space) helps declutter the UI and improve focus. Elements need breathing room to enhance readability and usability, making content easier to scan.",
        "Use consistent padding and margins. Following an 8px or 4px spacing system helps maintain a structured and balanced layout across different screen sizes and resolutions.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Color and Contrast",
      content: [
        "Colors impact user perception. A simple, well-balanced color scheme enhances aesthetics and usability, reinforcing brand identity while improving readability.",
        "Use high contrast for readability (e.g., dark text on a light background). Stick to a limited color palette and avoid unnecessary gradients or excessive shadows that can reduce clarity and visual hierarchy.",
        "Color psychology plays a role in UX. Cool tones evoke calmness, warm tones create energy, and neutral shades provide balance. Ensure accessibility by testing color contrast and avoiding color combinations that hinder readability for visually impaired users.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Touch and Interaction Design",
      content: [
        "Buttons, gestures, and animations should feel smooth and natural. Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels for accessibility, making interactions effortless and reducing frustration.",
        "Use motion subtly—smooth transitions and microinteractions should enhance the experience, not distract from it. Animations should provide feedback, such as button press effects or loading indicators, to guide users.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Icons and Imagery",
      content: [
        "Icons should be intuitive and universally recognizable. They help users navigate and understand actions quickly. Use a consistent style and size for icons throughout the app.",
        "Images should be high quality and relevant. They can enhance the visual appeal and provide context, but avoid overloading the interface with too many images, which can slow down performance.",
        "Optimize images for different screen sizes and resolutions. Use responsive images and consider using vector graphics (SVGs) for scalability and clarity on various devices.",
      ],
    },
