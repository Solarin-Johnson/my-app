# React Native Playground 🎮

My personal [Expo](https://expo.dev) playground for React Native animations and UI experiments.

## Prerequisites

This project requires a development client - you cannot use Expo Go.

## Get Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build the development client

**For iOS Simulator:**

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

**For Android Emulator:**

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npx expo start --dev-client
```

## What's Inside 🧪

- **Keyboard Controller** - Keyboard handling
- **Gesture Navigation** - Custom gesture experiments
- **Twitter Profile** - Animated profile interactions
- **Threads Pull Refresh** - Pull-to-refresh animations
- **Grok Sidebar** - Animated sidebar with blur effects

## Notes

- ⚠️ Expo Go is NOT supported
- 📱 Development client must be installed first
- 🔄 Rebuild only when native dependencies change
